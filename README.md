# python_password_logger_encrypt
Using an encrypting/decrypting file and python to create a password log for multipurpose use.

## Getting Started
This is just a fun side project that I created for my own entertainment. This project allows anyone to create their own unqiue code file to encrypt/decrypt passwords. However, this project can also be used to encrypt/decrypt secret messages for those who are interested in that type of thing. I have provided an elementary character encrypter and decrypter file to get you started. These files can be edited to create your own unique customized code encryption.

Run `Encryption.py`. The program will prompt you to either enter 1 or 2 (encrypt or decrypt). 
Encrypt:
Choose what password you are encrypting for (i.e. Yahoo, Runsecape, GMail, etc.). Then type in your password. You will see your encrypted code in the file `password_log` which can be decrypted by running the program again - choose option 2 (decrypt). 
Decrypt:
Type in what password you are decrypting for (i.e. Yahoo, Runsecape, GMail, etc.) and viola! There is your password.

## Prerequisites
* Python

## Installing
Just install the files provided in the repository, everything should be included except for Python. You can download Python at this [link](https://www.python.org/)

## Running Tests
Examples can be seen in the file `password_log` where I stored encrypted passwords as `example` and `example2`. When configuring your own unique encrytion file, make sure each code is uniquely different from the others since the decrypter method of decryption is not the best. I will be continuing to improve this porject as I move along with my other projects.

## Built With
