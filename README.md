# python_password_logger_encrypt
Using an encrypting/decrypting file and python to create a password log for multipurpose use.

## Getting Started
This is just a fun side project that I created for my own entertainment. This project allows anyone to create their own unqiue code file to encrypt/decrypt passwords. However, this project can also be used to encrypt/decrypt secret messages for those who are interested in that type of thing. I have provided an elementary character encrypter and decrypter file to get you started. These files can be edited to create your own unique customized code encryption.

Run `password_logger.py` and type in what password you are encrypting for (i.e. Yahoo, Runsecape, GMail, etc.). Then type in your password. You will see your encrypted code in the file `password_log` which can be decrypted by `decrypter.py` by typing in what password you are decrypting for (i.e. Yahoo, Runsecape, GMail, etc.).

## Prerequisites
* Python

## Installing
Just install the files provided in the repository, everything should be included except for Python. You can download Python at this [link](https://www.python.org/)

## Running Tests
Two examples can be seen in the file `password_log` where I stored two encrypted passwords as `example` and `example2`. When configuring your own unique encrytion file, make sure each code is uniquely different from the others since the decrypter method of decryption is not the best. I will be continuing to improve this porject as I move along with my other projects.

## Built With
